# Mode analysis of the passive and active slab waveguides using scattering matrix

We present a general approach for numerical mode analysis of the multilayer slab waveguides using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) instead of the Finite Difference Frequency Domain (FDFD) method. 
TMM consists of working through the device one layer at a time and calculating an overall transfer
matrix. Using the scattering matrix technique, we develop the proposed method for multilayer structures. 
We find waveguide modes for both passive and active slabs upon determinant analysis of the scattering matrix of the slab. Our proposed technique is more efficient and faster than other numerical methods.
